Investigating the Effect of the 2022 ASUU Strike on the Academic Performance of Students at the University of Lagos

## Project Description

This project aims to investigate the impact of the 2022 ASUU strike on the academic performance of students at the University of Lagos. We plan to use Python and Power BI for data analysis and visualization, and will collect data via a Google Form. The project will consist of four phases: planning and preparation, data collection and preparation, modeling and analysis, and reporting and presentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code for this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI

### Installing

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Open the Jupyter Notebook files to run the code and perform data analysis
- Open the Power BI file to visualize the data

## Data Collection

We will be using a Google Form to collect data for this project. The link to the form will be distributed to relevant stakeholders, including students, lecturers, and administrators.
The data collection for this project is live, to participate you can click on this : <https://forms.gle/1XZBC5EkMbsRTYJ4A> to fill the google form.
